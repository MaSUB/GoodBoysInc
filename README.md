This project is for CMPSC421 at Penn State Behrend.
The idea behind the project is to utilize IBM's Watson to do background checks using only what the user allows us to see. In our case this would be twitter and facebook data along with a written portion about why they want a dog. This project uses express.js as well as two NPM plugins for accessing Twitter and Facebook's APIs.
